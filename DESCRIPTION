Description: Provides an R wrapper for the 'MD4C' (Markdown for 'C') library. 
    Functions exist for parsing markdown ('CommonMark' compliant) along with support for other common
    markdown extensions (e.g. GitHub flavored markdown, 'LaTeX' equation support, etc.). The 
    package also provides a number of higher level functions for exploring and manipulating markdown
    abstract syntax trees as well as translating and displaying the documents.
